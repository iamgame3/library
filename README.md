# Library Project

This project is meant to test my ability to make objects, manipulate their information, and use their information in the DOM.

Enter some information about a book (Name, Author, how many pages, and if you've read it or not) and a card will be made for it. You can add new cards, remove cards, and toggle the read status. This information won't save when you refresh the page.

P.S. This project is a part of The Odin Project's course.
